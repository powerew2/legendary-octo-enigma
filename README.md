How did you know this was going to be chess?

Run ChessBoardTest.java for a new chessboard.
Click on one piece to select it and click a valid square to move the selected piece there.
Game starts on white and will shuffle turns with each move.

This is Material Chess, so the goal of the game isn't to keep your king alive.
Everything has been assigned a material value, even the king.
Rook: 5       Bishop: 3
Knight: 3     Queen: 9
King: 10      Pawn: 1
The game can only end in two ways: One side only has pawns left or a total of 100 moves has been played.
When the game ends, the side with the higher total material wins. No "fancy" moves either.
Since you no longer need to keep the king on the board, moves like castling have been disabled.
